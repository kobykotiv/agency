GitHub Copilot: Here's a structured plan to integrate Crew AI into the chatbot-ui project:

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui`
   - Create a new branch: `git checkout -b crew-ai-integration`
   - Install dependencies: `npm install crew-ai`

2. **Core Integration Points**
   - Modify the chat interface to support Crew AI agents
   - Add Crew AI configuration
   - Create API endpoints for Crew AI interactions

3. **Key Features to Implement**
   - Agent management system
   - Task definition interface
   - Process monitoring
   - Agent-to-agent communication display
   - Task status tracking

4. **File Modifications Needed**
   ```markdown
   /components/chat/
   - Modify Message.tsx to handle Crew AI message types
   - Update ChatInput.tsx for task submissions
   
   /types/
   - Add CrewTypes.ts for Crew AI specific interfaces
   
   /utils/
   - Add crewAI.ts for Crew AI initialization and management
   
   /api/
   - Add crew/ directory for Crew AI specific endpoints
   ```

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for Crew AI integration
   - Integration tests for agent interactions
   - End-to-end testing for complete workflows

6. **Implementation Phases**
   1. Basic Crew AI setup and configuration
   2. Agent management implementation
   3. Chat interface modifications
   4. Task handling and monitoring
   5. UI/UX improvements
   6. Testing and debugging
   7. Documentation updates
