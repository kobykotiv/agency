## Implementation Guidelines

1. **MVP Focus**: Each feature is designed with a minimal viable product approach, focusing on essential functionality while allowing for future expansion.

2. **Modularity**: Features are designed to be modular, allowing independent development and deployment.

3. **Scalability**: Database schemas and API endpoints are designed with scalability in mind.

4. **Security**: Security considerations are built into each feature specification.

5. **Integration**: Clear integration points are defined between features.

## Common Patterns

All feature specifications follow these common patterns:

- REST API endpoints
- Standardized database schemas
- Clear security considerations
- Integration requirements
- Error handling approaches

## Advanced Features

The additional features (11-13) enhance the platform with:

1. **Collaboration & Sharing**
   - Multi-level role system
   - Granular permissions
   - Workspace collaboration

2. **Enhanced Context**
   - Rich metadata management
   - Advanced search capabilities
   - Relationship tracking

3. **Tool Generation**
   - Custom tool creation
   - Testing framework
   - Marketplace integration

## Next Steps

1. Review each specification in detail
2. Prioritize features for implementation
3. Create technical design documents
4. Set up development environment
5. Begin incremental implementation

## Note

These specifications serve as a foundation and may evolve based on development needs and user feedback. Each feature can be implemented independently while maintaining the ability to integrate with other features.
