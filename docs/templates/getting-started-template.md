# Getting Started with CrewAI

Welcome to CrewAI! This guide will help you set up your environment and create your first AI crew.

## Overview
CrewAI is a platform that enables you to create and manage teams of AI agents that work together to accomplish complex tasks. This guide covers the essential concepts and steps to get you started.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Python 3.8 or higher installed
- Node.js 18 or higher installed
- Basic understanding of Python/JavaScript
- API keys for your preferred language models

## Installation

### 1. Install CrewAI
```bash
# Using npm
npm install @crewai/platform

# Using Python
pip install crewai
```

### 2. Configure Your Environment
Create a `.env` file in your project root:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
CREWAI_ENVIRONMENT=development
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Your First Crew
```python
from crewai import Crew
from crewai.agents import Agent

# Create agents
researcher = Agent(
    role="Researcher",
    goal="Research and analyze data",
    backstory="Expert data analyst with focus on market trends"
)

writer = Agent(
    role="Writer",
    goal="Create engaging content",
    backstory="Experienced content writer with marketing expertise"
)

# Create crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[
        "Research market trends",
        "Create content based on research"
    ]
)

# Execute crew tasks
result = crew.execute()
```

### 2. View Results
```python
print(result.output)
print(result.task_results)  # Individual task results
```

## Core Concepts

### Agents
Agents are AI-powered workers with specific roles, goals, and capabilities. Each agent can:
- Execute assigned tasks
- Interact with other agents
- Access tools and resources

### Tasks
Tasks are units of work assigned to agents. They include:
- Clear objectives
- Required inputs
- Expected outputs
- Success criteria

### Crews
Crews are teams of agents working together. They provide:
- Task orchestration
- Agent collaboration
- Resource management
- Result handling

## Common Issues and Solutions

### API Key Configuration
```bash
Error: OpenAI API key not found
Solution: Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is set in your .env file
```

### Agent Communication
```python
# Enable debug logging for agent communication
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
