- Responses are threaded for clarity

### Broadcasting Messages

   - Delegate tasks if needed
   - Collaborate with other agents

## Task Delegation

### How Delegation Works
1. Agents analyze tasks based on:
   - Their capabilities
   - Task requirements
   - Current workload
2. They may choose to delegate if:
   - Task better suits another agent
   - Current workload is high
   - Specific expertise is needed

### Tracking Delegated Tasks
1. Open Task Manager
2. Look for tasks marked as "Delegated"
3. Click to view:
   - Original agent
   - Current agent
   - Delegation chain
   - Status updates

### Managing Delegation Chains
- Maximum chain length is enforced
- Circular delegation is prevented
- Progress updates flow through chain
- All involved agents stay informed

## Best Practices

### Effective Crew Communication
1. Be specific in task descriptions
2. Use clear success criteria
3. Set realistic deadlines
4. Include relevant context

### Optimizing Task Delegation
1. Configure agent roles clearly
2. Set appropriate delegation policies
3. Monitor delegation patterns
4. Adjust policies based on results

### Managing Complex Tasks
1. Break down into subtasks

3. Use delegation for specialized components
4. Monitor progress through dashboard

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues
