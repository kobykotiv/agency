# CrewAI Cloner Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for building a CrewAI cloner that will:

1.  Export a YAML file into a deployable web application.
2.  Abstract away the terminal commands.
3.  Bootstrap a Gradio front end for the CrewAI.
4.  Write documentation about it.

## Detailed Plan

1.  **Implement YAML export:**
    -   Investigate existing CrewAI configuration formats.
    -   Implement functionality to export the CrewAI configuration to a YAML file.
    -   Ensure the YAML file contains all necessary information to recreate the CrewAI.

2.  **Create a web application:**
    -   Choose a web framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular).
    -   Create a web application that can load and deploy CrewAI configurations from YAML files.
    -   Implement a user interface for managing CrewAIs.

3.  **Abstract terminal commands:**
    -   Identify the terminal commands required to run the CrewAI.
    -   Implement the web application to abstract away these commands.
    -   Provide a user-friendly interface for running the CrewAI without using the terminal.

4.  **Bootstrap Gradio front end:**
    -   Integrate a Gradio front end to provide a user interface for creating and managing CrewAIs.
    -   Allow users to define agents, tasks, and crews through the Gradio interface.
    -   Generate the corresponding YAML configuration file.

5.  **Write documentation:**
    -   Write documentation for the CrewAI cloner, including instructions on how to use it.
    -   Provide examples of how to create and deploy CrewAIs using the cloner.
    -   Include a troubleshooting section for common issues.

## Technologies

-   Python
-   CrewAI
-   YAML
-   Web framework (React, Vue, or Angular)
-   Gradio

## Progress

### Completed
1. **Investigated existing CrewAI configuration formats:**
   - Analyzed existing YAML configuration files in the project
   - Understood the structure of agents.yaml and tasks.yaml

2. **Implemented YAML export functionality:**
   - Created export.py script to export crew configurations to YAML
   - Successfully tested the export functionality

3. **Started web application implementation:**
   - Created CrewImporter.tsx React component
   - Implemented file upload and YAML parsing
   - Added topic variable configuration

### Next Steps
1. **Create backend API endpoints:**
   - Implement /api/crew/import endpoint to handle YAML imports
   - Implement /api/crew/deploy endpoint to deploy crews
   - Add validation and error handling

2. **Abstract terminal commands:**
   - Create backend service to handle crew deployment
   - Implement proper error handling and logging
   - Add status monitoring for running crews

3. **Bootstrap Gradio front end:**
   - Set up Gradio interface for crew management
   - Integrate with existing React frontend
   - Add real-time status updates

4. **Write documentation:**
   - Document API endpoints
   - Add usage examples
   - Include troubleshooting guide
